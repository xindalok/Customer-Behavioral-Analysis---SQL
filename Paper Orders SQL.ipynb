    "### SUM Questions:\n",
    "1. Find the total amount of poster_qty paper ordered in the orders table.\n",
    "2. Find the total amount of standard_qty paper ordered in the orders table.\n",
    "3. Find the total dollar amount of sales using the total_amt_usd in the orders table.\n",
    "4. Find the total amount spent on standard_amt_usd and gloss_amt_usd paper for each order in the orders table. This should give a dollar amount for each order in the table.\n",
    "5. Find the unit cost of each paper.\n",
    "\n",
    "### MIN, MAX, & AVG Questions:\n",
    "6. When was the earliest order ever placed?\n",
    "7. Try performing the same query as in question 6 without using an aggregation function.\n",
    "8. When did the most recent (latest) web_event occur?\n",
    "9. Try to perform the result of the previous query without using an aggregation function.\n",
    "10. Find the mean (AVERAGE) amount spent per order on each paper type, as well as the mean amount of each paper type purchased per order. Your final answer should have 6 values - one for each paper type for the average number of sales, as well as the average amount.\n",
    "\n",
    "### GROUP BY Questions:\n",
    "11. Which account (by name) placed the earliest order? Include the account name and the date of the order.\n",
    "12. Find the total sales in USD for each account. You should include two columns - the total sales for each company's orders in USD and the company name.\n",
    "13. Via what channel did the most recent (latest) web_event occur, which account was associated with this web_event? Your query should return only three values - the date, channel, and account name.\n",
    "14. Find the total number of times each type of channel from the web_events was used. Your final table should have two columns - the channel and the number of times the channel was used.\n",
    "15. Who was the primary contact associated with the earliest web_event?\n",
    "16. What was the smallest order placed by each account in terms of total USD? Provide only two columns - the account name and the total USD. Order from smallest dollar amounts to largest.\n",
    "17. Find the number of sales reps in each region. Your final table should have two columns - the region and the number of sales reps. Order from fewest reps to most reps.\n",
    "18. For each account, determine the average amount of each type of paper they purchased across their orders. Your result should have four columns - one for the account name and one for the average quantity purchased for each of the paper types for each account.\n",
    "19. For each account, determine the average amount spent per order on each paper type. Your result should have four columns - one for the account name and one for the average amount spent on each paper type.\n",
    "20. Determine the number of times a particular channel was used in the web_events table for each sales rep. Your final table should have three columns - the name of the sales rep, the channel, and the number of occurrences. Order your table with the highest number of occurrences first.\n",
    "21. Determine the number of times a particular channel was used in the web_events table for each region. Your final table should have three columns - the region name, the channel, and the number of occurrences. Order your table with the highest number of occurrences first.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Using DISTINCT Questions:\n",
    "22. Use DISTINCT to test if there are any accounts associated with more than one region.\n",
    "23. Have any sales reps worked on more than one account?\n",
    "\n",
    "### HAVING Questions:\n",
    "24. How many of the sales reps have more than 5 accounts that they manage?\n",
    "25. How many accounts have more than 20 orders?\n",

    "27. How many accounts spent more than 30,000 USD total across all orders?\n",
    "28. Which accounts spent less than 1,000 USD total across all orders?\n",
    "29. Which account has spent the most with us?\n",
    "30. Which account has spent the least with us?\n",
    "31. Which accounts used Facebook as a channel to contact customers more than 6 times?\n",
    "32. Which account used Facebook most as a channel?\n",
    "33. Which channel was most frequently used by most accounts?\n",
    "\n",
    "### DATE Functions Questions:\n",
    "34. Find the sales in terms of total dollars for all orders in each year, ordered from greatest to least.\n",
    "35. Which month did Parch & Posey have the greatest sales in terms of total dollars? Are all months evenly represented by the dataset?\n",
    "36. Which year did Parch & Posey have the greatest sales in terms of total number of orders? Are all years evenly represented by the dataset?\n",
    "37. Which month did Parch & Posey have the greatest sales in terms of total number of orders? Are all months evenly represented by the dataset?\n",
    "38. In which month of which year did Walmart spend the most on gloss paper in terms of dollars?\n",
    "\n",
    "### CASE Questions:\n",
    "39. Write a query to display for each order, the account ID, total amount of the order, and the level of the order - ‘Large’ or ‘Small’ - depending on if the order is 3000 USD or more, or smaller than 3000 USD.\n",
    "40. Write a query to display the number of orders in each of three categories, based on the total number of items in each order. The three categories are: 'At Least 2000', 'Between 1000 and 2000' and 'Less than 1000'.\n",
    "41. We would like to understand 3 different levels of customers based on the amount associated with their purchases. The top level includes anyone with a Lifetime Value (total sales of all orders) greater than 200,000 USD. The second level is between 200,000 and 100,000 USD. The lowest level is anyone under 100,000 USD. Provide a table that includes the level associated with each account. You should provide the account name, the total sales of all orders for the customer, and the level. Order with the top spending customers listed first.\n",
    "42. We would now like to perform a similar calculation to the first, but we want to obtain the total amount spent by customers only in 2016 and 2017. Keep the same levels as in the previous question. Order with the top spending customers listed first.\n",
